# Welcome in guesThesNumber solidity contract!

First thing to know is, when you deploy contract, pick your name and the lucky number, you will become an ORIGINAL participant! Isn't that cool?!
Well, it also take you out of the game, so you should be testing it with different addresses. 
The rules are as easy as they can be: register your name to be able to play and try to guess the number! EASY! but be carefull, 
you have only three attempts. Oh yeah, the number is a one digit number. Just to make it fair for other players ;)

There is whole list of participants, who tried to guess the number, that you can check and see how they did. 
Also a preview winner's address, so you could send him some ETH and bribe him/her to send you the number. 
Imagine the flex that you guessed it in one attempt!

Have fun! 

P.S don't worry if you misspelled your username, you can always correct it.
